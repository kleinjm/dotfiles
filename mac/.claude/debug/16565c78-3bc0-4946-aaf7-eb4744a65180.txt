This eliminates route duplication and conditional logic throughout controllers, forms, and presenters.\n\n## Changes\n\n### Route Consolidation\n- Merged separate `buyer_entities` and `seller_entities` routes into single `customer_entities` resource\n- Use `customer_type` query parameter (`buyer` or `seller`) instead of separate route paths\n- Applied same pattern to personal information, identification, and legal ownership routes\n\n### Controller Updates\n- Updated `CustomerEntitiesController`, `PersonalInformationsController`, `IdentificationDocumentsController`\n- Extract `customer_type` from query parameter or customer record\n- Set correct menu item (`:fincen_buyers` or `:fincen_sellers`) based on customer type\n\n### Form Updates\n- Changed `form_as` methods to return `:customer` instead of `:buyer`/`:seller`\n- Ensures consistent form parameter naming (`customer[...]`)\n- Updated form URLs to include `customer_type` parameter\n\n### Presenter Updates\n- Added `include Rails.application.routes.url_helpers` to presenters\n- Simplified path method calls (removed verbose `Rails.application.routes.url_helpers.` prefix)\n- Updated all path helpers to use unified routes with `customer_type` parameter\n\n### Bug Fixes\n- Fixed menu item activation by downcasing `customer.type` before comparison\n- Added menu item activation to personal information and identification controllers\n- STI returns capitalized class names but constants are lowercase\n\n### Test Updates\n- Updated all system and request specs to use new route structure\n- Fixed form field selectors (`buyer_*` → `customer_*`)\n- Updated redirect and button text expectations\n\n## Impact\n\n- Net reduction: ~230 lines of code\n- Reduced route complexity: 2 route definitions → 1\n- Improved maintainability: single code path for both customer types\n- No breaking changes to functionality\n\n## Test Results\n\nAll specs passing:\n- System specs: 4/4 passing (buyers, sellers)\n- Request specs: 4/4 passing (customer entities, personal info, identification)\n- Personal information specs: 1/1 passing\n- Identification document specs: 3/3 passing\n\nFixes #1726\nEOF\n)\""
