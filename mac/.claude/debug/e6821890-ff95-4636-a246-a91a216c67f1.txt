Enable it only for dev and test envs. Then disable it using Conditional verification (see docs) in every controller that inherits directly from application controller. Disable it with a TODO referencing this project. As we go through each phase, we will remove the disable and enforce the policy moving forward. Along the way, add TODOs to consider moving non-base controllers to inherit from base controllers based on their routes. For example, WireInstructionsController should probably inherit from a base controller that inherits from application controller instead of application controller directly")

Enable it only for dev and test envs. Then disable it using Conditional verification (see docs) in every controller that inherits directly from application controller. Disable it with a TODO referencing this project. As we go through each phase, we will remove the disable and enforce the policy moving forward. Along the way, add TODOs to consider moving non-base controllers to inherit from base controllers based on their routes. For example, WireInstructionsController should probably inherit from a base controller that inherits from application controller instead of application controller directly")

Referrence this project and in make a note in the spec to update that documentation in the final phase of the project (at which point it will all be enforced). Note that all new controllers and actions should use policies going forward. Also note in the doc that we're not going to be following the Pundit pattern for https://github.com/varvet/pundit?tab=readme-ov-file#strong-parameters strong parameters because it's too much of an abstraction and better readability to have the params in the controller. And for tests, we should try to do everything in memory using Object.new or build rather than create. There are going to be a lot of tests and we need them to be fast and avoid hitting the database as much as possible. This may be easier for policies than scopes. Let's only have one test for scopes that sets up all the data necessary and runs expectations against all happy and sad paths. Setting up the data is expensive. Testing against it is cheap")
