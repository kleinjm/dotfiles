[DEBUG] UserCommandMessage rendering: "agent-os:write-spec is running…" (args: "The goal is to decouple the models that back the SOI form from the SOI form and namespace and instead tie directly to the Customer record that they belong to. This is because they represent information about the customer and that is agnostic of where the data in their tables comes from.
- Remove the `StatementOfInfo::` namespacing for all the SOI models. This will require a migration, renaming of all the files, and updating all the call sites. The StatementOfInfo model itself should not change at all. For example, `StatementOfInfo::Family` should just become `Family` and the filename should become `app/models/family.rb`
- All the same models should remove their `statement_of_info_id` and add a `customer_id`.
- All these tables can be truncated because the feature isn't live yet. That will make it easier to do all this work in one branch. The `customer_id` field should be an indexed foreign key that is non nullable.
- The namespacing of the services, controllers, forms, etc. for statement of info DO NOT change. Just the underlying data models' namespacing and relationship from statement_of_info -> customer. Much of the logic, params, and likely hidden fields need to change but the functionality of the SOI flow should remain exactly the same. 
- Note that PersonalInformation is a model that is part of the SOI flow but is not in the SOI namespace so it does not need to change. It can be used as an example of the end goal for all these tables.
- Ensure all SOI related tests still pass; unit, request, and system.
- Write a spec that addresses each SOI:: model as a phase. Each phase will be one branch and one PR.")
