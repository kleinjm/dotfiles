# Git Workflow and Commit Guidelines

This document outlines git workflows, commit standards, and deployment processes for EscrowSafe.

## Commit Message Format

- Use conventional commit format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
- Focus on technical achievements and business impact in commit descriptions

## Commit and Push Policy

- NEVER commit and push changes unless explicitly directed by the user
- Always ask for permission before running git commit or git push commands
- User will specify when changes are ready to be committed
- **NEVER use `git add -A` or `git add .`** - Always stage specific files explicitly to avoid committing unintended changes
- **NEVER use `git commit --no-verify`** - Pre-commit hooks must pass for CI to succeed. Always fix RuboCop, database consistency, and other linting issues before committing rather than bypassing hooks
- Use `git diff --cached` to review staged changes before committing
- Only add files that are directly related to the current work

## Deployment

### Staging

- **Staging**: Force push your branch to the `staging` branch to trigger auto-deployment
  - `git push -f origin your-branch-name:staging`
  - This will automatically deploy to the staging environment

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Link to relevant GitHub issues using "Fixes #issue-number" or "Closes #issue-number"
- Include task links, screenshots, and clear descriptions
